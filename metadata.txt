Time spent
- Approximately 60 minutes of implementation and debugging time (excluding environment setup and dependency installation).

AI tools used
- OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5.1 Thinking), via the ChatGPT web interface.

How I used AI
- Used AI to:
  - Propose and refine the overall architecture (domain/infrastructure/UI separation).
  - Generate the initial project structure, including Streamlit UI, SQLAlchemy models, and repository layer.
  - Draft the first version of tests and the GitHub Actions CI workflow.
  - Help with small refactors and fixes (e.g., Streamlit form behavior and widget handling).
- I manually:
  - Reviewed and adjusted all generated code for consistency.

Implemented scope (high level)
- Single-user TODO app with:
  - Persistent storage using SQLite + SQLAlchemy.
  - Streamlit UI for creating, listing, filtering, and editing TODO items.
  - Support for title, description, status (pending/done), due date, priority, and tags.
  - Basic filtering by status, priority, and “due today or overdue”.
- Automated checks:
  - pytest-based tests for core logic and persistence.
  - ruff + black + mypy integrated in a GitHub Actions workflow (CI.yml) on ubuntu-latest.

Further changes I would make with more time
- Testing and robustness
  - Expand test coverage (more edge cases, end-to-end tests exercising the UI-independent layers).
  - Add more robust input validation and error handling on the service layer (e.g., invalid dates, overly long titles).
- Architecture and APIs
  - Introduce a small REST API (e.g., FastAPI) on top of the domain layer, with autogenerated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.
  - Split configuration and environment concerns more cleanly (config file/env vars instead of hardcoded values).
- Deployment and tooling
  - Dockerize the application (Dockerfile + optional docker-compose) for easier local deployment and reproducibility.
  - Add pre-commit hooks for ruff/black to keep style consistent.
- UX and features
  - Improve UX in the Streamlit app (better layout, clearer status indicators, improved tag management).
  - Add simple search over title/description.
  - Add optional reminders/notifications and recurring tasks support.
